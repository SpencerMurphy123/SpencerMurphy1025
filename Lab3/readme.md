# Executive Summary
The goal of Lab 3 is to get ourselves familiar with different types of software while also practicing with programming languages like Python. The application of virtualization is also a topic that will be covered. We will also be exploring different career options in the IT field along with co-ops, internships, etc.
## Software
Software, created by programming, is designed to give instructions to the surrounding hardware. It can be split into two categories: operating systems software and application software. Operating systems (Windows, IOS) manage the user-interface components and hardware, while providing programmers a platform to write new applications. Application software (Microsoft Word, Itunes) allows the user to accomplish a goal or objective. Utility software (which is a subcategory of Application) allows the user to modify or fix your computer. An antivirus software is an example. ERP software (Enterprise Resource Planning) was designed to funnel an entire organization under one software application. A central database is established by said software which is then implemented throuhgout the organization. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle are examples of this. Virtualization creates a virtual computer system that allows for numerous applications and operating systems to be ran on a single server. This was designed as a result from companies previously using multiple servers, functioning at a fraction of their capacity, which then leads to high cost and inefficiency. Software called a "hypervisor" is used when multiple VM's (virtual machines) are operating on a single host. This allows for resources to be allocated to whichever VM as needed.
