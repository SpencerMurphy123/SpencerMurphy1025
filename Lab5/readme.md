# Executive Summary
Lab 5 consists of networking and cybersecurity. We will look at different approaches and technologies that help reduce threats to security and identify the different networking components along with the role of the NSA in networking security. We will also be taking a look at lucidchart as a way to create simple and clear charts.
### Lucidchart
My exeperience with Lucidchart was pretty simple. I understood the format of the system pretty well even though it was my first time, and the only really challenging part was finding out the code required for the program.
### Introduction to Networking
A packet is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet. These units travel through a network that connects multiple devices together and filters packets based on their destination called a packet-switch. The destination of the packet is represented by an IP address, or a specific number that is unique to a computer. Everyone has one. IP addresses are stored in a directory called the "DNS" or "domain name system," and can be pulled out of that system for proper routing. Protocol is the ability for devices to exchange information back and forth across a network via a set of rules.
##### Network Hardware
Switches are better options than hubs as they can pass along trafic (or data) at higher rates resulting in improved efficiency. It is more intelligent than a hub and can join mulitiple computers within one LAN. Routers have more benefits than both a hub and a swtich, however. While switches work to connect multiple computers within one network, routers work to connect multiple networks together. Routers can perform a variety of intelligent tasks across many networks while the other two deal with connections within a single network.
##### Network Topologies
Single point of failure occurs when a central wiring point like a switch or hub fails, resulting in the failure of attached devices. Star and ring topology deal with this issue. Wireless mesh topology consists of many connected routers intertwined over many networks (i.e the internet). Infrastructure topology (IT) utilizes both wired and wireless topologies. Similar to the star topology, IT has multiple devices connected to a central wiring point, which is also connected to a wireless access point that allows for laptops, smartphones, etc. to be connected to the network. I think the wireless mesh is superior because you can just keep adding more routers to ensure that there is no failure in the system.
