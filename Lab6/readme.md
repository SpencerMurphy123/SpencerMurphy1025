# Executive Summary
In lab 6 we will be exploring protocols that support communication on the Internet as well as more programming methodologies. We will also be looking at how to create and format a web page utilizing HTML and CSS.
### Internet Architecture
##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a unique number that is assigned to any device connected to the Internet. The number is specific to that unit, meaning no other device uses it. IPv4 was the original version o IP addresses in use, with it having the ability to generate about 4.3 billion unique addresses. It consisted of a string of 4 groups of varying numbers and letters, hence the 4 in the name. IPv6 differs from the previous version as it adds 2 more groups to the string. This led to more address combinations being generated which in turn allowed the population of the world, and then some, to have access to their own personal IP.
