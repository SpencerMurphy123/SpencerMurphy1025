# Executive Summary
## Conclusion
### Hardware 
Latency is the average time it takes for a sector to position itself under a head while transfer rates describe the speed at which data is transferred to and from disk media
Solid state hard drives differ from the traditional hard drive by having no moving components which allows for no latency experience. Information can be accessed immediately and less can go wrong mechanically.
