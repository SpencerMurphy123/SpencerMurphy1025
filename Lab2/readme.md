# Executive Summary
## Hardware 
Latency is the average time it takes for a sector to position itself under a head while transfer rates describe the speed at which data is transferred to and from disk media.
Solid state hard drives differ from the traditional hard drive by having no moving components which allows for no latency experience. Information can be accessed immediately and less can go wrong mechanically.
More RAM makes a computer run faster as it increases the speed at which memory transfers information to other components without the need to access the hard drive. 64 bit data paths work at double the speed of a 32 bit, making them faster and more efficient in data input.
## Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit
Under the command of the Control Unit, the ALU performs all of the mathematical operations indside the CPU. The Control Unit receives instructions from the RAM which then gets passed on as operations to the ALU. Output from the ALU gets temporarily stored inside the register powered by the Control Unit which is then transferred to the CPU bus.
## Hardware: CPU, Input & Output
Regarding self-checkout, input would be the money you pay for whatever you are purchasing. Money goes into the machine via cash or card. The CPU then calculates the amount owed and charges the card or takes the required amount of cash. The output would then be your receipt and the ownership of your new goods.
## Hardware: Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table describes the behavior of input and output values. NAND gates have two inputs and the resulting outputs are always true with the execption of a double true input, which then the output would be false. The AND gate is the exact opposite with the resulting outputs always being false with the exception of a double false, which then the output would be true.
## Hardware: IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization, with its goal to serve the world technological innovations with the help from a society of computer scientists, software developers, etc. Maintaining proper ethics regarding technological advancement are imperative as the impact has the possibility of affecting millions of people. The five areas of ethical focus are as follows: Accountability, Value Alignment, Explainablity, Fairness, and User Data Rights. Accountabiltiy claims that those who design programs like AI should be the ones to wonder or worry about the ramifications of said programs. Value Alignment is described by the need to have programs share the norms and values of the group responsible. Explainability describes the need for programs to be easily detected and monitored. Fairness is included to eliminate bias found in humans. User Data Rights decribes the preservation and protection of private data or information.
### Data Representation: Numeric Conversions
Decimal numbers consist of combination ten digits or values from 0 to 9 while binary is formed by two digits (1,0). The hexadecimal is equivalent to four binary digits (base 16).
### Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation
#fb016b is represented by 100% red, 0.4% green, and 42% blue. The only people this color would be problematic to are people with color blindness conditions. Certain conditions can make this color look brown, light blue, or gray.
