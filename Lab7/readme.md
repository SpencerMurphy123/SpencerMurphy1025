# Executive Summary
In lab 8, we look at some of the ethical and legal implications of information systems. We will also be describing various database models and practice querying a database with SQL.
### Data, Information, and Knowledge
#### Relational Knowledge
Data consists of raw pieces of information that is useless on their own, with information adding context to these bits. Knowledge, then, is the product of the consumption of information. The primary key in a customer and orders table is probably customer ID. The foreign key would then be the link between data in the customer and orders table. Two reasons why data types are so important are the fact that data type tells the database what functions can be performed with the data. The other reason to define data type is that it allows for the proper amount of space to be allocated to that data.
#### Big Data
The four V's of big data include volume, variety, veracity, and velocity. Volume represents the amount of data and is one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”. Variety defines different types of data and data resources. Velocity is the  characteristic that represents the motion of the data. Veracity can be termed as the trustworthiness of the data i.e. calculation of the noises, biases and abnormality in the data. Technology that has driven the need for big data include unstructured data like web pages, audio logs, and even twitter feeds.
### Structured Query Language 
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The data in RDBMS in database objects called tables, consisting of rows and columns. The orders and shipping tables relate to each other as the shipping table must receive info from the order table to be able to tell where deliveries go. The order table is the primary key with the shipping table being the foregin key.
