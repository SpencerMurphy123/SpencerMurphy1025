# Executive Summary
In lab 7 we will be looking into the concept of file compression, and exploring its impact while working with files and folders. We will also define the OOP (object oriented programming) paradigm while practicing creating and diagramming software.
### File Compression
Compressed or Zip files take up less storage space on a computer and can be transferred more quickly. Zip files archive multiple files together to act like one singular file. The original file size of my svg image is 2,844 bytes. When compressed, my image takes up about 1,751 bytes of space. If the image was a jpg, it might have not compressed as significantly as types like those are usually already compressed.
### Object Oriented Concepts
When ordering at a drive-through window at your favorite establishment, you, your order, and the food stand as objects. The restaurant as a whole and the processes it goes through works as the class. In the case of the shark class, Sammy is the object. The class is the shark, abstraction is swimming, encapsulation is the specific type of shark, and inheritance is the definition.
