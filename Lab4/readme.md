# Executive Summary
Lab 4 explores operating systems even further, and we start to practice with the command line of our operating system. Additional software will also be examined including: interactive programming environment, graphics and diagramming. Our study of python will also be continued.
### Python IDLE
The interactive shell differs from the file editor as the shell runs python instructions as soon as you hit RETURN, and it also has the >>> prompt. The file editor allows you to save those instructions in a file and run a program. It does not have the >>> prompt.
